## Initial Setup

### Clone the Repository (Only Needed Once)
```sh
git clone git@github.com:BenogisInnovations/Crew-lessons.git
cd Crew-lessons
```

### Create and Switch to Their Branch (Only Needed Once)
Replace `your-branch-name` with your actual name or a unique identifier.
```sh

```

## Pulling Updates from the Main Branch

Whenever the main branch is updated with new assignments, follow these steps:

1. **Switch to the Main Branch and Pull Updates**
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Switch Back to Your Branch**
   ```sh
   git checkout your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Merge the Main Branch into Your Branch**
   ```sh
   git merge main
   ```
   If there are conflicts during the merge, resolve the conflicts, stage the resolved files, and commit the merge.
   ```sh
   # Resolve conflicts
   # Stage resolved files
   git add <file-with-conflict>
   # Commit the merge
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts from main"
   ```

4. **Push Your Updated Branch**
   ```sh
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
