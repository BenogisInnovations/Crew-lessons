1. Below are some variables. Group them in arrays. Put the first set into a single array and the second set in another array.
2. Use For Loop, Foreach Loop, and While Loop to run each array and echo all the elements in each array.
NB: In all you should have 9 loops, since you will be running 3 loops on each array.
Remeber to comment your code and use camel case for the variable naming.


$country1 = 'Germany';
$country2 = 'Benin';
$country3 = 'Ghana';
$country4 = 'England';
$country5 = 'France';
$country6 = 'Korea';

$Capital1 = 'Berlin';
$Capital2 = 'Porto-Novo';
$Capital3 = 'Accra';
$Capital4 = 'London';
$Capital5 = 'Paris';
$Capital6 = 'Seoul';
